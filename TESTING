The visual tests included here do not occur in dieharder or
TestU01.  Dieharder and TestU01 have statistical versions of
these tests.  To test eegl with dieharder or TestU01, feed
the output from eeglraw into those test suites.

------------------------------------------------------

Test eegl by running tsteegl.  There are no parameters.

./tsteegl

The output from tsteegl is a block of 1000 random bits.

------------------------------------------------------

eegl uniform distribution chi square test.
There are no parameters.

./eeglchi

The output from eeglchi is a chi square of 16384
4-bit samples.  Number of degrees of freedom is 15.

------------------------------------------------------

Binomial distribution chi square test.
There are no parameters.

./binom

The output from binom is a chi square of 65536
16-bit samples.  Number of degrees of freedom is 16.

------------------------------------------------------

Poisson distribution chi square test.
There are two parameters, lambda and size of population.

./poischi lambda size

Example:

./poischi 6 100000

The output from poischi is the chi square with
number of degrees of freedom, based on lambda.

------------------------------------------------------

Test eeglunif() and eeglint() by running tstnc.
This test requires the new curses package.

sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev

tstnc uses one parameter, the number of states in eegl.

./tstnc 2000

The output from tstnc is a random pattern of ASCII characters
on a curses screen.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Test eeglpwr() by running tstdots.
This test requires X Windows.

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

tstdots uses one parameter, the number of states in eegl.

./tstdots 2000

The output from tstdots is a random bitmap pattern of pixels 
on an X Windows screen.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Walk Test:  tstwlk.sh
tstwlk.sh illustrates a random bit stream piped into a
down stream program.
This test requires X Windows.  See sudo apt-get above.
tstwlk.sh uses one parameter, the number of states in eegl.

./tstwlk.sh 2000

The output from tstwlk.sh is a random walk relative to a midpoint
line on an X Windows screen.  To quit press any key.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Powerball Simulation:  pwrball
pwrball is a random lottery game based on real odds
and real pay-outs.
This test requires new curses.  See apt-get above.

./pwrball

The output from pwrball shows money spent and money
received for each prize level.  To quit press 'q'.
The grand totals are in millions of dollars.
The lesser prizes are in thousands of dollars.

------------------------------------------------------

Dieharder Test:  tstdie.sh
Dieharder has to be installed first.

sudo apt-get install libdieharder-dev
sudo apt-get install dieharder

tstdie.sh illustrates a raw stream of random data piped into a
down stream test suite.

./tstdie.sh

The output from tstdie.sh is a statistical report.
This is a long running test.  To interrupt press CTRL-C.
The first test takes half minute to print a report.

------------------------------------------------------

TestU01 is more difficult to run with the eegl generator.
You have to download the TestU01 package and then compile it.
Then you have to write and compile a test program in the
examples directory of TestU01.  The short guide for TestU01
gives you examples of how to set up a test.  In particular,
you need to use ufile to read input from eeglraw in your test.
After you get over the learning curve, you will be rewarded
with some strong and varied tests.
